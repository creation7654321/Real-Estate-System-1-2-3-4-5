Export your WordPress emails to CSV, EML, or Excel with ease using our intuitive exporter. You can filter the logs by date range, search term, or other criteria to extract only the data you need for your reporting or analysis.

#### Print Emails

Our email logging feature allows you to easily print any email in a clear and easy-to-read format, making it simple to keep track of important email communications. Additionally, you can export email logs to PDF format for convenient digital archiving.

#### Email Reports

Track email deliverability and engagement with our email reports feature, which displays open and click-through rates grouped by subject line. The reports also include information on sent and failed emails each week, ensuring that you're always aware of potential issues. Plus, you can view an email report chart right in your WordPress dashboard for quick and easy access.

#### Weekly Email Summary

Stay on top of your WordPress email statistics with our weekly email reports, sent to your inbox. These reports provide in-depth information on the number of emails sent, as well as opens and clicks.

### Other Notes

Inspired by [WP Mail SMTP](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) plugin

== Installation ==

1. Install Easy WP SMTP either via the WordPress.org plugin repository or by uploading the files to your server. (See instructions on <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" rel="friend">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>)
2. Activate Easy WP SMTP.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can this plugin be used to send emails via Outlook, Gmail, Google Workspace, Hotmail, Yahoo, Zoho SMTP? =

Yes, it can. You should use the dedicated Gmail or Outlook mailer options, since they are faster and more reliable, compared the the "Other SMTP" mailer.

If you want to use other providers, you'll need to select the "Other SMTP" mailer and configure the correct SMTP host details.

= What to do if you need help or have an issue? =

Please open a new <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/easy-wp-smtp/">support thread</a> and provide as much information as possible, without any private information (it is a public forum).

And we will try to help out as soon as possible.
